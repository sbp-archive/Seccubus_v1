18-2-2011 Seccubus 1.5.5 - Fixed installer error

If the installer changed files by means of the sed command a new file was
created which takes the permissions from the system umask. This caused some
files not to have the correct permissions as reported by Stephen Stormont in
ticket #13 (https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/seccubus/ticket/13)

7-2-2011 Seccubus 1.5.4 - OpenVAS-Client 3.x compatibility release

This release fixes an OpenVAS-Client 3.x compatibility issue reported and fixed
by Brad Alexander

Frank,

Please find the attached do-scan script. The problem was that OpenVAS-clients
versions 2 and before as well as nessus (all versions that I was able to test)
use -v to determine the version, whereas OpenVAS-Client version 3 (and
presumably version 4, which is in alpha/beta now) uses -V

As a quick fix, I reversed the test, so that it tests for nessus rather than
openvas-client, as follows

Is it nikto? -> yes -> run nikto test
  | no
 V
Is it nessus? -> yes -> run nessus
  |
 V
It's openvas -> run openvas

Note that I have the following versions of the tools to test against:
OpenVAS-Client -> 2.0.5, 3.0.0 (server version 3.0.4) Nessus -> 2.2.10, 4.2.2
and 4.4.0

In any case, let me know your comments on my changes. I can send you a diff
file, if you prefer, when I get home. The license, obviously, on my changes
are gpl, but I got bitten on not specifically stating that on my blog.

Thanks,
--b

Seccubus v1.5.3 - Lots of small bugs, still make a lot of noise

Ticket [ 3105978 ] - POSTSCAN canot be used to mail html report
Moved evaluation of POSTSCAN parameter till after HTMl reprots are generated

Ticket [ 3085944 ] - CWE: references not hyperlinked
Added a line to SeccubusWeb.pm to render the missing links

Ticket [ 3061224 ] - When nikto asks for input MODE=nikto scans "hang"
Added the Nikto option -ask auto to the default config file. Users who
allready have such a configuration file are encouraged to add this line
themselves

Ticket [ 3060441 ] - MODE=safe line in do-scan overwrite settings in config
Moved MODE=safe to top of file

Ticket [ 3054350 ] - Certain OpenVAS packages use -V for version 
(in stead of -v)
Redirected stderr to stdout so error does nto show in output anymore

Ticket [ 3011447 ] - Unsupported report type 'xml'
Report type no longer gets rendered for Nessus, just of OpenVas

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Seccubus v1.5.2 - If at first you don't succeed...

Added Scanmonitor by Isac Balder
See: http://dc214.defcon.org/notes/scanmonitor.pl

Provided RELEASENOTES.txt

Ticket [ 3057382 ] - RPM assumes dependancies on nessus and mod_perl

The RPM installed assumed dependancies on nessus and mod_perl. While most use
of Seccubus is with nessus, it can also be used with OpenVAS and/or Nikto
without havving nessus installed, so this is not a hard dependancy

Ticket [ 3057381 ] - CONFIG path wrong in config.dist

In config.dist the CONFIG variable was set to /home/seccubus/bin this should
have read /home/seccubus/etc. Kudos to Stephen Stormont for spotting this.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

27-08-2010
Seccubus v1.5.1 - Emergency fix

Ticket [ 3054336 ] - Perl scripts refer to $CONFIG

When preparing for RPM installer some changes where made, this caused
view_finding.pl not to find ignored_diffs anymore

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

01-08-2010
Seccubus v1.5.0 - The Defcon 18 and Nikto compatibility release

Ticket [ 2979354 ] - Nikto compatibility

Creating a scan with "mode='nikto'" will fire off a Nikto scan from the server
running Seccubus, if nikto is installed (remote scanners are currently not 
supported).

The configuraiton file allows you to pass additional parameters to nikto.

Ticket [ 2978649 ] - Seccubus cannot handle compliance plugin output

It has turned out that in a Nessus .nbe file the same host/port/plugin
combination can appear more then once, e.g. when dealing with compliancy
plugines (e.g. plugin number 21157). Seccubus will now test if an entry for a
certain host/port/plugin combination allready exists and if so it will append
the finding to the entry in stead of overwriting the entry.

Also the output of compliace type plugins is a bit large.
If the plugin is one of the compliancy then the first word (sequence of 
non-space characters) is added to the plugin number

Ticket [ 2978437 ] - Typo in line 46 of do-scan
Corrected typo

Ticket [ 2978573 ] - New ignored_diffs
Updated

Ticket [ 2981907 ] - Online up2date check
up2date.pl makes an http connection to the seccubus website to determine is
the current version of Seccubus is up to date.

Ticket [ 2986053  ] - Findings >150 characters not truncated
In certain circumstances, findings with > 150 characters were not propperly
truncated in the web gui. This is now fixed

Ticket [ 2986061 ] - Odd rendering of MS bulleting links
Only render MS type text into a hyperlink if it is not preceeded by a slash.

Ticket [ 2984464 ] - ignore ASP.Net_SessionId 
Added the line below to ignore_diffs
[\+\-] \d+\s+value = .*?\n?

Ticket [ 3025145 ] - Provide RPM installer
Thanks to Peter Slootweg an RPM is now also available for easy installation

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Seccubus v1.4.1 - Nessus 4.2 compatibility release - Thanks Isac Balder

Ticket [ 2954813 ] - Parsing of hostnames
The get_hostnames routine of SeccubusWeb.pm does not parse the hostnames
file correctly if it is a symlink to /etc/hosts.

An entry like:
1.2.3.4 abcmadm1 abcmadm1.abc.local cvs #This is a comment

Returns 'abcmadm1 abcmadm1.abc.local cvs #This is a comment' as the
hostname.

Ticket [ 2962660 ] - update-nessusrc not comptible with Nessus 4.2

Update-nessusrc did not handle Nessu 4.2 port 1241 connections right
Thanks to Isac Balder for providing a fixes update-nessusrc file

Ticket [ 2954186 ] - Still some AutoNessus references

Removed last autonessus references (I hope)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Seccubus v1.4 - Thy new name is...

Ticket [ 2916275 ] - Rechristen tool Seccubus

Ticket [ 2916290 ] - Directory traversal vulnerability in get_report.pl
get_report.pl failed to do proper input validation when constructing a
filename from user input. This lead to a directory traversal vulnerability
which enable a remote (authenticated) user to read arbitrary files on the
server with the rights of apache process.
While Seccubus supports user authentication it does not enforce that
authentication is configured upon installation of Seccubus

Ticket [ 2916282 ] - do-scan enhancement, create dirs if they don't exist
If the directories findings and output are not present in var/<scanname> e.g.
because the user did not copy .skel, but created files manually, do-scan will
now create them for him.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Seccubus v1.3.2 - Fixing some bugs

Ticket [ 2849220 ] - do-scan errors
Running the scan by hand results in
bin/do-scan: line 45: nessus: command not found

Added an echo to a wrong statement in do-scan

Ticket [ 2849229 ] - Nessus 4 compatibility
The update-nessusrc script was not compatible with Nessus4. Downloaded a new
version from http://www.tifaware.com/perl/update-nessusrc/ and changed it to
be compatible with Seccubus

Ticket [ 2740544 ] - XSS protection in diff kills formatting
XSS filtering of diffs killed the markup inserted by ignored diffs. I now do
the XSS filtering before I insert the markup so that the markup does nto get
killed anymore

Ticket [ 2793178 ] - Odd rendering of CVE references
Tenneable now shows both CVE references and links to CVE references in its
code:

RedHat reported a null-pointer dereference flaw while processing
monochrome ICC profiles (CVE-2009-0793). ....
See also :
http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0581

CVE references will only be updated if not preceeded with a = sign.

Ticket [ 2783580 ] - Missing EMAIL= not handled gracefully
No email will be sent without email address

Ticket [ 2783579 ] - Characters missing from URL
Added @ and " as valid URL characters

Ticket [ 2568643 ] - No help availabel for undefined
Calling help only when ScanStatus changes

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Seccubus v1.3.1 - Nessus 2.2.5 Compatibility

Ticket [ 2740102 ] Nessus v 2.2.5 issue
It seems that the OpenVAS compatibility release broke downwards compatibility
with Nessus 2.2.5 (guess which version happened to be installed at the office)

Seccubus now detects if the OpenVAS or Nessus client is used and switches
the command line arguments based on that.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
23-3-2009
Seccubus v1.3.0 - OpenVAS compatibility release

Ticket [ 2316867 ] - OpenVAS compatibility
Seccubus is now OpenVAS compatible.

In order to make Seccubus work with OpenVAS you will need to change the
NESSUSBIN parameter in either ~/etc/config or ~/var/<scanname>/config to point
to your OpenVAS-Client binary. You also need to change the mode of to scan an
append openvas to it (e.g. MODE=full becomes MODE=full-openvas)

Changes where needed to the following files:
* process-scan.pl -     Due to differendces between OpenVAS and Nessus .nbe
			file format
* do-scan -             Due to slightly different command line handling
                        between OpenVAS-Client and Nessus client
* etc/config.dist -     To show an example OpenVAS setup

Also additional nesssusrc files where needed because OpenVAS has a different a
configuration file format.

Ticket [ 2653614 ] - Problems with mode=portscan
When you execute a mode=portscan scan and the portscan.nessusrc file contains
an empty plugin section, nessus populates the plugin section with undesirable
default settings. I have updated update-rcs to now populate the plugin section
of the portscan.nessusrc with all current plugins with setting no.

Ticket [ 2604472 ] - Predicatable diffs v1.2.5
Added predicable diffs to ignored-diffs

Ticket [ 2592187 ] - New autoremarks
Added autoremarks

Ticket [ 2609184 ] - XSS in view_finding.pl
While the primary plug in output was properly sanitized, the diff output and
historical plugin output was not properly sanitized.

Script tags returned by Nessus plugins were not propperly escaped. Should an
attacker be able to force a Nessus or OpenVAS plugin to return malicious
script, this script would executed when it was displayed as a diff or as
historical plugin output.

While the attack was real and demonstrated via the output of plugin 14260
(nikto) it was hard to execute.

Ticket [ 2705701 ] - CVE entries were not properly formatted (missing ( )
Fixed the regexp in add_external references

The install script now takes the parameter --bash to allow for the
location of the bash sheel to be specified.

BUG [ 2537456 ] - _blank iso _new
Replaced _new with _blank in the following files:
SeccubusWeb.pm
editHostfile.pl
getFindings.pl
getScanInfo.pl

BUG [ 2537365 ] - Do not allow the user to select non recommended statusses
In order to make the system more "fool proof" (it will not work fools are a
lot smarter then you thing) statuses that are not recommended can no longer
be selected.

BUG [ 2155173 ] - Add CVSS base score calculation link
Added the CVSS2 calculation link

BUG [ 2144346 ] - Predictable diffs
Updated ignore_diffs and added some new diffs to be ignored.

BUG [ 2433020 ] - AutoRemarks
Added three autoremarks

BUG [ 2531288 ] Bulk update on a large number of items
I was using a get method for the bulk update methode and hitting the limit on
the Apache server as well as the OS limit on how long a cgi parameter can be.
I changed this to use a POST request instead of a get request.

BUG [ 2521076 ] - Finding without findings...
Delta engine now marks a finding GONE when there is no data in it unless it
is marked FIXED.

Seccubus v1.2.4 - Bugfixes

BUG [ 2407614 ] - Add_remark broken
Changed "$date - text" to "$date - $text" in add_remark function in
process_scan.pl

BUG [ 2152839 ] Comment add seems to overwrite
Back to perl 101. When you want to read a complete file into a scalar var,
this is what you will have to do:
$var = join("", <HANDLE>);
not:
$var = <HANDLE>;
As this will only give you the first line.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5-12-2008
Seccubus v1.2.3 - Buggy bugfixes

BUG [ 1996774 ] Comment overwrite should be off by default
Seems it is not fixed.
Line should have read
print "<input type=checkbox name=overwrite>Overwrite\n";
In stead of:
print "<input type=checkbox name=overwrite checked=false>Overwrite\n";

BUG [ 2392801 ] AutoRemark did not correctly detect if comment allready
present
I misunderstood the index function so my earlier bugfix killed this function

BUG [ 2152839 ] Comment add seems to overwrite
I have updated the update_remark function and modified do_scan.pl. 
update_remark is now more in line with autoupdate_remark which does seem to 
work well.

Chaned the spelling of changed to the correct one ;)
